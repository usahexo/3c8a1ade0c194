#  Wagering Requirements For The Gala Bingo Baccarat Rouge 540 Sample

Wagering requirements must be fully understood before players can indulge in games such as roulette, blackjack and baccarat. Different casinos have different playthrough rules, which is why it is important to understand these prior to signing up and making a deposit.

Players need to check if the amount they want to wager is worth the associated Wagering Requirements (WR), especially when playing high stakes games. In some cases where the WR's are high, it might make more sense to gamble at a casino offering lower WR's even though the bonus amount may be lower. Wagering requirements dictate how much money you must bet before you're allowed to withdraw any winnings you make while playing with bonus funds awarded to you from the casino.

The Wagering Requirements (WR) for the Gala Bingo Baccarat Rouge 540 game are forty times (40x) the bonus amount. So, in order to cash out any winnings generated from the $10 free chip bonus, players must first wager a total of $400 ($10 x 40). This means that players cannot simply claim their free chip and walk away with any winnings; they must first playthrough the required amount on eligible games before withdrawing any funds. Wagering on Roulette will not contribute 100% towards meeting the WR's; rather it only contributes 60%. Baccarat and Blackjack both contribute at a rate of 80%.

#  How To Play The New Gala Bingo Baccarat Rouge 540 Sample

The new Gala Bingo Baccarat Rouge 540 Sample is the perfect game for experienced and novice players alike. The aim of the game is to bet on the outcome of the player's hand or the banker's hand. The player's hand is always compared to the banker's hand, even if the player has bet on the bank winning.

To play, first decide how much you would like to bet. You can either bet on a single number or choose a range of numbers. Then place your chips in the corresponding spots on the betting table.

The game begins with two cards being dealt to both the player and banker. The value of these cards is added up and this is your total score. Face cards (King, Queen and Jack) are worth 10 points each, while an Ace is worth 1 or 11 points (whichever gives you the best score).

If your total score is 8 or 9, you 'stand'. This means you do not take any more cards. If your total score is less than 8, you must take another card (unless you have already stood). If your total score is 10 or more, then you can choose to take another card (or not).

Your goal is to beat the banker's total score with your own hand. If you succeed, you win! If not, then you lose your bet.
