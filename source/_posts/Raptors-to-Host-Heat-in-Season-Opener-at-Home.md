#  Raptors to Host Heat in Season Opener at Home

The Toronto Raptors will open their season at home against the Miami Heat on October 17th. This matchup is sure to be exciting, as both teams are expected to contend for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

The Raptors will hope to build on last year's success, which saw them finish 3rd in the East with a record of 51-31. They'll be led by All-Star guard Kyle Lowry, who averaged 22.4 points and 7.0 assists per game last season. Other key players include DeMar DeRozan, Serge Ibaka, and Jonas Valanciunas.

The Heat finished 41-41 last season and missed the playoffs by one game. They'll be led by superstar guard Dwyane Wade, who is in his final season before retirement. Other key players include Goran Dragic, Hassan Whiteside, and Josh Richardson.

This should be a close matchup, with both teams having plenty of talent. The home court advantage could be decisive, so the Raptors will need to take care of business at the Air Canada Centre if they want to start the season off with a win.

#  How Much Did Drake Spend on the Raptors?

Drake has been a fixture at Raptors games for years, sitting courtside and supporting the team. This season, it was announced that the rapper had become the team's global ambassador. But some say he has gone too far, spending too much of the team's money.

There's no doubt that Drake has brought a lot of attention to the Raptors. The team has seen record ticket sales and sellouts since he became involved. And some sponsors have credited Drake with helping them to sign new deals.

But how much of the Raptors' money has Drake actually spent? It's hard to say for sure, but reports estimate that he has spent millions of dollars on the team.

Much of this money has gone towards tickets and travel costs. Drake is known for flying in friends and family to watch him at games, and often buys large blocks of tickets so they can all sit together. He has also been known to charter jets to fly his entourage to away games.

In addition, Drake has reportedly paid for team dinners, wardrobe changes for players, and other expenses. In one instance, he even bought the entire team new suits for an event.

It's unclear whether Drake will continue to spend this much money on the Raptors now that he is their global ambassador. But if he does, it could end up costing him a lot of money.

#  Atlantic Division Champions!

The Toronto Raptors are the Atlantic Division Champions! The season was full of ups and downs, but the Raptors were able to overcome them all and come out on top.

The Raptors started the season off strong, winning their first six games. However, they then went on a six-game losing streak. They were able to bounce back and finish the season with a record of 49-33, which was enough to win the division.

Kawhi Leonard was a huge reason for their success. He averaged 26.6 points per game and led the team in rebounds (7.3) and assists (3.3). Pascal Siakam also had a great season, averaging 16.9 points per game. He also led the team in blocks (1.7).

The Raptors will now go on to face the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round of the playoffs. The Bucks have had an amazing season, but the Raptors are definitely not afraid of them. They are looking to make it all the way to the NBA Finals this year and bring home the championship trophy!

#  DeRozan and Lowry Lead Raptors to Historic Season

The Toronto Raptors had an historic season this year, led by DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. They entered the playoffs as the third seed in the Eastern Conference, but were upset by the Washington Wizards in the first round.

DeRozan had a breakout season, averaging 27.3 points per game. Lowry also had a great season, averaging 22.4 points and 7.0 assists per game.

The Raptors have a young core that should be able to contend for years to come. DeRozan and Lowry are both under contract through 2019-20, and they have several other talented players on their roster, including Jonas Valanciunas and Norman Powell.

The Raptors will have to make some adjustments this offseason, but they should be able to compete for the Eastern Conference title next year. Thanks for a great season, Toronto!

#  Are the Toronto Raptors NBA Champions?

Only time will tell, but the Toronto Raptors have made it to the NBA Finals for the first time in their history and they just may be able to bring home the championship. Kawhi Leonard, who was acquired in a trade with the San Antonio Spurs last year, has been key to their success. He is a two-time Defensive Player of the Year and was the MVP of the 2014 NBA Finals when he was with the Spurs.

The Raptors had a somewhat shaky start to the season but managed to pull together and finish as the second seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, they defeated Milwaukee Bucks in six games, Philadelphia 76ers in seven games, and Boston Celtics in five games. Leonard led both teams in scoring, averaging 30 points per game against Boston.

In contrast, the Golden State Warriors had an easy ride through the playoffs. They swept Denver Nuggets in four games and Houston Rockets in six games before defeating Portland Trail Blazers in four games in the Western Conference Finals. Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson are arguably one of the most talented groups of players ever assembled and are favourites to win another championship.

The Warriors are looking to win their third championship in four years while Leonard is looking to win his first championship. It should be an exciting matchup between these two teams.
