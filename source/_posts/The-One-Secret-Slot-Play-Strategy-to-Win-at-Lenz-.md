#  Slot Machine Strategy Guarantees Winnings at Bundle of Money Horse Slot Machine Lenz

There are so many slot machines on the casino floor, but at Bundle of Money Horse Slot Machine Lenz there is one machine that always guarantees a win. It's called the "Strategy Slot Machine."

The Strategy Slot Machine is never the first or last machine on the row, and it's never in the middle. It's always one to the side of where people are standing.

To play this slot machine, you need to insert your bill into the machine and press the button on the right side. This will start the game.

You will then see 15 different horses on the screen. Nine of those horses are grey, and six are brown. The object of the game is to pick which three horses will finish in first, second, and third place.

Your money is not at risk because if you lose, you get to keep your money! So even if you only pick two out of three correctly, you still win!

To increase your chances of winning even more, here is a strategy to follow:

# 1 - Look at all 15 horses and find the three that are most different from each other.



















     As you can see, these horses are all very similar in color and markings. Therefore, it would be difficult to choose one of these horses as a winner. Instead, look for three horses that are completely different from each other. This could be a mix of colors or markings. # 2 - Bet small amounts of money at first If this is your first time playing the Strategy Slot Machine or if you don't want to risk too much money, start by betting $1 per round. You can bet more money if you want to maximize your chances of winning, but I recommend starting small so you don't lose too much if you don't win. # 3 - Pick the horse that is in first place If one of your three chosen horses is in first place according to the race shown onscreen, then select that horse as one of your winners. # 4 - Select two other horses If none of your three chosen horses are in first place according to the race shown onscreen, then select two other horses as winners instead. These do not have to be from among the nine grey horses; they can be any two brown horses as well.
