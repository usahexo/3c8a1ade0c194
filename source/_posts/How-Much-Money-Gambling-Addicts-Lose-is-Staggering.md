#  Study: Gambling Addicts Lose $104,000 on Average

According to a recent study, gambling addicts lose an average of $104,000 per year. This is more than twice the amount of money that non-gambling addicts lose.

The study, which was conducted by the University of British Columbia, surveyed nearly 2,000 people who had problems with gambling. It found that gambling addicts lost an average of $91,000 more than non-gambling addicts.

They also found that the majority of gambling addicts (59%) had experienced major financial problems as a result of their addiction, such as bankruptcy, job loss, and home foreclosure.

Experts say that the findings highlight the need for better treatment options for gambling addiction. Currently, there are very few treatments available that are specifically tailored for this type of addiction.

“Our findings suggest that gambling addiction is a major problem in terms of economic health,” said lead author Dr. Anna Sergunina. “This is especially true for those addicted to internet gambling or slot machines.”

Dr. Sergunina added that more research is needed to determine why some people become addicted to gambling while others do not. She also called for better prevention and treatment programs for gambling addiction.
