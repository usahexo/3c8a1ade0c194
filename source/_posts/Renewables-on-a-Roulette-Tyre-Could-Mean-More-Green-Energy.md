#  Renewables on a Roulette Tyre Could Mean More Green Energy

It's a sunny day as you drive to work, so you roll down the windows and enjoy the breeze. You think about how great it is that more people are using renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. As you pull into the parking lot, you see a large wind turbine.

You go to your desk and turn on your computer. Your phone beeps with a notification from an app that shows how much energy you're using at that moment. It's mostly from the overhead light, but you also see that your phone is charging wirelessly. You smile, knowing that even though your employer isn't completely powered by renewables yet, it's getting closer every day.

The global market for renewables is expected to grow from $2 trillion in 2017 to $4 trillion by 2030, according to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). This growth is being driven by falling costs for solar and wind power, as well as rising demand for electric vehicles and storage solutions.

Renewables are now the cheapest form of electricity in more than 30 countries, according to IRENA. In 2017, renewables made up 24 percent of global electricity generation, and this is expected to grow to 40 percent by 2030.

"Renewables are revolutionising the energy sector, with record-breaking investment and falling costs translating into more jobs, more reliable and cheaper power supplies," said IRENA Director-General Adnan Z. Amin. "This growth is being driven by cost reductions across technologies and mounting investor confidence."

China is leading the way in renewables deployment, accounting for nearly half of all global renewable energy investment in 2017. The United States was second with $30 billion invested in renewables last year. India was third with $11 billion invested in renewables in 2017.

We are seeing great advancements in renewables technology all over the world," said Vishal Shah, Vice President at IHS Markit and Head of Energy Storage & Electric Transportation at IHS Markit."The next big battleground will likely be Asia Pacific - especially China - where we expect installations of distributed solar systems to outstrip those in Europe very soon."
This momentum is translating into jobs: There are now more than 10 million people employed globally in renewable energy-related jobs, according to IRENA estimates. In Europe alone there are now more than 1 million people employed in renewables development - an increase of 300 percent since 2010."Governments must put in place policies that enable continued growth of renewable energy," said Amin."This includes securing a market place for renewables through effective regulation and market design; adopting creative financing mechanisms; establishing lasting partnerships with the private sector; and ensuring seamless grid integration."

#  Could Renewable Energy Spell the End for Fossil Fuels?

Renewable energy has been making headlines as of late, with some heralding it as the end of fossil fuels. But what is renewable energy, and is it really poised to take over the energy market?

Renewable energy typically refers to sources of energy that are environmentally sustainable and derived from natural resources–such as water, wind, and sunlight. Renewables can be used to generate electricity, heat buildings, or produce transportation fuels.

Compared to traditional fossil fuels like coal and oil, renewables offer a number of advantages. They are emissions-free, meaning they do not produce greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. They are also more versatile; renewables can be harnessed domestically or remotely, making them ideal for rural and remote communities. And unlike nuclear power, renewables are relatively safe and dosimeter.

Wind turbines at nightTransitioning to renewables presents a number of challenges as well. The technology is not yet as developed as traditional fossil fuels, meaning costs are higher. And many renewables require significant land area for installation–such as dams for hydroelectricity or solar arrays for solar power.

But despite these challenges, renewables are growing rapidly. In fact, renewables accounted for more than two-thirds of new global electricity capacity in 2017. This growth is being driven by a number of factors: maturing technologies, declining prices, rising public acceptance, and stronger policy frameworks.

So far, the biggest adopters of renewables have been wealthier countries in Europe and North America. But developing countries are catching up fast; in 2017 alone, renewable energy capacity grew by 50% in China and by nearly 30% in India.

All indications point to surging demand for renewable energy in the years ahead. Some experts believe that renewables could overtake fossil fuels as the world’s primary source of energy within the next few decades. While that may be ambitious goal, it’s clear that renewables are playing an increasingly important role in the global energy landscape

#  Is Renewable Energy the Future of Our Planet?

There is a lot of discussion around renewable energy and its potential to secure our planet’s future. But what does that really mean for us? How accessible is this kind of energy, and is it really the best option?

Renewable energy comes from sources that are naturally replenished and include solar, wind, water, geothermal, and biomass. These sources provide cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels and emit significantly less greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), renewable energy can already meet most of our electricity needs when paired with energy storage.

The cost of renewable energy has been dropping dramatically in recent years as technologies have become more efficient and scalable. Solar power is now one of the cheapest forms of new electricity generation in many parts of the world. In some countries like Denmark, Germany, India, and Spain, wind and solar power are now cheaper than coal-fired power plants.

The switch to renewables is happening faster than anyone thought possible. In 2017, renewables accounted for more than two-thirds of all new global power capacity. Renewables are also becoming increasingly popular with businesses and households alike. Many companies are now committing to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, including Apple, Walmart, Google, Facebook, Ikea, Johnson & Johnson, and Coca-Cola.

So why aren’t we all using renewables yet? The main challenge facing widespread adoption is the variability of renewable energy sources. Solar and wind power production can be affected by weather conditions and require storage solutions to ensure a reliable supply of energy when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. Advances in storage technology are making this a less pressing issue, but it remains a significant obstacle to large-scale adoption.

Another challenge is that the infrastructure needed to support renewables—such as transmission lines and storage facilities—often requires government subsidies or regulations to be profitable for investors. This can make renewables less attractive compared to traditional fossil fuels in some places. Policymakers need to put in place the right incentives to overcome these challenges and expedite the transition to renewables.

The good news is that renewable energy is becoming more affordable every day and growing in popularity worldwide. With continued investment in research and development, we can expect even more progress in this area in the years ahead.

#  Going Green: How Renewable Energy is Saving Our Planet

Renewable energy is becoming more and more popular, as people are looking for ways to save our planet. Renewables can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change, and can also create jobs and promote economic growth.

There are many different types of renewable energy, including solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal. Solar energy is created when sunlight is converted into electricity. Wind energy is generated by the wind turning turbines to create power. Hydroelectricity is created when water flows through a turbine to generate power. Geothermal energy uses the earth’s natural heat to create power.

Renewables are becoming more affordable as technology improves, and they are now being used in many different applications. Renewables can be used to generate power for homes and businesses, or to fuel vehicles. In some cases, renewables can also be used to produce heat and cooling.

Renewables have many benefits for our planet. They help reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, they create jobs and promote economic growth, and they are becoming more affordable every day. We need to continue investing in renewables so that we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and save our planet.
