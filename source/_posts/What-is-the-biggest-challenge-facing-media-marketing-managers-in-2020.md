#  What is the biggest challenge facing media marketing managers in 2020?

The biggest challenge facing media marketing managers in 2020 is adapting to the ever-changing landscape of digital media. With new platforms and devices emerging all the time, it can be difficult to keep up with the latest trends and determine how to best reach audiences through these channels. Another challenge is managing the ever-growing data pool that is associated with digital marketing, and figuring out how to use it to optimize campaigns.

#  What changes do you need to make to your marketing strategy to keep up with changing trends?

Social media is a powerful tool for engaging with your target audience. Use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media platforms to share your content, engage with followers, and generate leads. Paid advertising on social media can also be very effective in reaching more people.

3. Invest in SEO.

SEO is still one of the most effective ways to reach potential customers online. Investing in SEO can help you rank higher in search engine results pages, which means more people will see your website and potentially become customers.

4. Use lead generation forms.

Lead generation forms are a great way to capture information from potential customers interested in your product or service.

You can then follow up with these leads to convert them into customers.
