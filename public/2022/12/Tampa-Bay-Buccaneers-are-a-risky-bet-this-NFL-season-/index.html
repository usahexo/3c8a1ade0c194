        <h1 id="Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-are-a-risky-bet-this-NFL-season"><a href="#Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-are-a-risky-bet-this-NFL-season" class="headerlink" title="Tampa Bay Buccaneers are a risky bet this NFL season"></a>Tampa Bay Buccaneers are a risky bet this NFL season</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are coming into the 2018-2019 NFL season with a lot of buzz. Many people are picking them to make it to the playoffs, and even the Super Bowl. However, I believe that the Buccaneers are a risky bet this year.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why I believe this. First of all, they have a new coach, Dirk Koetter, who is returning for his third year as head coach. While he has had some success in the past, it is uncertain how he will do with a new team. In addition, the Buccaneers lost their star wide receiver, Mike Evans, to injury early in the preseason. This will definitely impact their offensive performance.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Buccaneers’ defense was ranked one of the worst in the league last year. They were 31st out of 32 teams in terms of points allowed per game. It is uncertain if they will be able to improve this ranking this year.</p>
<p>All things considered, I believe that there are better bets than Tampa Bay this year. If you want to gamble on an NFL team, I would recommend looking elsewhere.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-bet-on-the-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-this-NFL-season"><a href="#How-to-bet-on-the-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-this-NFL-season" class="headerlink" title="How to bet on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this NFL season"></a>How to bet on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this NFL season</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are a professional American football team based in Tampa, Florida. The Buccaneers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league’s National Football Conference (NFC) South division.</p>
<p>The team currently has sixteenth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft. </p>
<p>This season, there are many ways to bet on the Buccaneers. </p>
<p>To start with, there is the point spread. This is a way of measuring how many points one team is expected to beat another by. Bettors can choose to either back the favorite or take the underdog, depending on what they think will happen in the game. </p>
<p>There is also the moneyline, which is a way of betting on who will win outright. This can be risky, but it can also payout big if you correctly predict the winner. </p>
<p>Finally, there are also various props bets that can be made on games. These include things like whether or not there will be a safety, how many points either team will score, and more. </p>
<p>No matter what type of bettor you are, there is something for everyone when it comes to betting on the Buccaneers this season!</p>
<h1 id="Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-Betting-Tips"><a href="#Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-Betting-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Betting Tips"></a>Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Betting Tips</h1><p>The Buccaneers have been a team on the rise over the past few years and they are looking to take that next step in 2018. With Jameis Winston at the helm, this team is capable of doing some damage in the NFC.</p>
<p>The Bucs will kick off their season on September 9th against the New Orleans Saints. This should be a great test for them early on, as the Saints are one of the top teams in the NFL. The Bucs’ defense will need to be sharp in order to keep up with Drew Brees and his offense.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay will also have to deal with some tough competition within their own division. The Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers, and New Orleans Saints are all capable of making noise in the playoffs. The Bucs will need to win some key games against these teams if they want to make it to the postseason.</p>
<p>As far as betting tips go, here are a few things to keep in mind when betting on Tampa Bay:</p>
<p>-The Bucs are a good bet against teams that have a weak offensive line. Their defensive line is one of the best in the league and they will be able to get after the quarterback.</p>
<p>-The Bucs are also a good bet against teams that struggle to run the ball. They have one of the better defensive units in the NFL and they will be able to stop opposing teams from running wild.</p>
<p>-Take Tampa Bay against teams that are turnover prone. Jameis Winston is a good quarterback and he will take advantage of opposing defenses that make mistakes.</p>
<h1 id="Odds-for-betting-on-the-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-this-NFL-season"><a href="#Odds-for-betting-on-the-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-this-NFL-season" class="headerlink" title="Odds for betting on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this NFL season"></a>Odds for betting on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this NFL season</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were one of the surprise teams in the NFL last season, going 9-7 and just missing out on the playoffs. This year, they are expected by many to take the next step and make a run at the Super Bowl. The oddsmakers certainly think so, as they have set the Buccaneers’ odds at winning it all at 16/1.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are plenty of other good teams in the NFL this year, so those odds aren’t exactly great. But if you think that Tampa Bay is going to be a contender this year, there’s still some good value to be had betting on them.</p>
<p>The Bucs have a lot of talent on their roster, starting with quarterback Jameis Winston. He had a breakout season last year, throwing for 4,090 yards and 28 touchdowns. He’ll be looking to build on that this year, and he has some good weapons around him, including receivers Mike Evans and DeSean Jackson.</p>
<p>The team’s running game is also in good hands with Doug Martin back from injury. He averaged 4.9 yards per carry last year and provides a strong running threat that can take pressure off of Winston.</p>
<p>On defense, Tampa Bay is led by superstar defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. He had six sacks last year and anchors a defense that was fourth in the NFL in yards allowed last season. They also have a veteran secondary led by cornerback Brent Grimes.</p>
<p>So overall, there’s a lot to like about the Buccaneers heading into this season. If you think they can live up to the hype and make a run at the Super Bowl, then betting on them may be a wise move.</p>
<h1 id="Can-the-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-be-profitable-to-bet-on-this-NFL-season"><a href="#Can-the-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-be-profitable-to-bet-on-this-NFL-season" class="headerlink" title="Can the Tampa Bay Buccaneers be profitable to bet on this NFL season?"></a>Can the Tampa Bay Buccaneers be profitable to bet on this NFL season?</h1><p>There is no clear-cut answer, but the Bucs have potential to be a profitable bet this year.</p>
<p> Tampa Bay finished last season 5-11, but there were definitely some positives to take away from their performance. Jameis Winston had a solid season, averaging over 245 passing yards per game and throwing for 27 touchdowns. The Bucs also have some good young talent on defense, including Vernon Hargreaves III and Lavonte David.</p>
<p>This year, the Bucs have a tough schedule but there are also some games that they could potentially win. Their opening game against the Chicago Bears should be a close one, and they also have matchups against the New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons later in the season that could be winnable.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s hard to know exactly how well the Bucs will perform this year. However, there is potential for them to be a profitable bet if you can find good odds.</p>
