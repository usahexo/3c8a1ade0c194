This Cinderella story has captivated the entire world, with 5000-1 odds underdog Leicester City pulling off perhaps the biggest upset in sports history.</p>
<p>From preseason relegation favorites to Premier League champions, manager Claudio Ranieri and his Leicester City side have defied all expectations this season. The Italian tactician has masterfully led his team to an unlikely title win, utilizing a strong defensive structure while also playing an attractive and entertaining style of football.</p>
<p>Leicester’s Premier League triumph is even more impressive when considering their offseason recruitment strategy. The Foxes only spent around £57 million on new players last summer, a tiny amount compared to the likes of Manchester City (£150 million) and Chelsea (£100 million).</p>
<p>Riyad Mahrez has been one of Leicester’s standout players this season, scoring 17 goals and providing 11 assists in 35 appearances. The Algerian winger has been vital to the Foxes’ success, providing a creative spark and match-winning moments on numerous occasions. Jamie Vardy has also been key for Leicester City, scoring 24 goals in 36 appearances in what has been a remarkable campaign for the 28-year-old striker.</p>
<p>Despite their underdog status, Leicester City never seemed overawed by their opponents this season. They consistently took the game to their opponents and were always capable of grabbing a crucial goal or two. The Foxes’ victory over Manchester United in late February was perhaps the highlight of their season, with Mahrez scoring a superb solo goal in a 3-1 win at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>Now that they have won the Premier League title, Leicester City will be looking to establish themselves as one of Europe’s top clubs. With Champions League qualification secured for next season, Ranieri and his team will be looking to cause an upset or two in Europe’s premier club competition.</p>
<p>No one could have predicted Leicester City’s fairytale title win at the start of the season, but they have now completed one of the most remarkable sporting upsets ever seen. Congratulations to Claudio Ranieri and his amazing squad on becoming Premier League champions!</p>
<h1 id="Unbelievable-Leicester-City-crowned-champions-of-England"><a href="#Unbelievable-Leicester-City-crowned-champions-of-England" class="headerlink" title="Unbelievable: Leicester City crowned champions of England"></a>Unbelievable: Leicester City crowned champions of England</h1><p>Leicester City Football Club (LCFC), commonly referred to as Leicester City, Leicester or The Foxes, is an English professional football club based in Leicester. The club was founded in 1884 as Leicester Fosse, playing on a field near Fosse Road. They moved to Filbert Street in 1891 and played there for 117 years, before moving to their current ground of King Power Stadium in 2002.</p>
<p>The Foxes won the League Cup in 1964 and were runners-up in the FA Cup twice, in 1948 and 1963. However, they had never won a major trophy until they were crowned Premier League champions on 2 May 2016. This made them the first team from outside the top division of English football to win the title. Claudio Ranieri, who was appointed as manager in July 2015, was credited with their success.</p>
<p>On 14 February 2016, LCFC defeated Manchester City 3–1 to move five points clear at the top of the Premier League table. This improbable turn of events later became known as “the Great Escape”. They then lost 1–0 away to Chelsea on 1 March, but two successive wins against Southampton and Sunderland coupled with Tottenham Hotspur drawing 2–2 with Chelsea on 2 May meant that Leicester City were crowned champions of England for the first time in their history.</p>
<p>The final match of the season saw them lose 1–3 away to Everton, but it mattered little as they could no longer be caught by second-placed Tottenham Hotspur. Jamie Vardy finished as the league’s top scorer with 24 goals, and Riyad Mahrez was named Player of the Season. After becoming champions, some players were rewarded with new contracts while others were sold to other clubs. Kasper Schmeichel signed a new five-year contract with the club while Danny Drinkwater and N’Golo Kanté both moved to Chelsea for a combined fee of £57 million.</p>
<p>Manager Claudio Ranieri also left unexpectedly just nine months after winning the title, raising concerns among some fans that history may be repeating itself after Nigel Pearson’s dismissal just a year after leading LCFC back into the Premier League following their relegation during the 2014–15 season. On 23 October 2017, Craig Shakespeare was sacked by LCFC despite having won eight out of 16 matches since being appointed caretaker manager following Ranieri’s departure</p>
<h1 id="FOX-SPORTS-Leicester-City-is-your-Premier-League-Champion"><a href="#FOX-SPORTS-Leicester-City-is-your-Premier-League-Champion" class="headerlink" title="FOX SPORTS: Leicester City is your Premier League Champion!"></a>FOX SPORTS: Leicester City is your Premier League Champion!</h1><p>It would be the biggest upset in Premier League history. </p>
<p>Leicester City was 5000-1 to win the Premier League at the start of the season. </p>
<p>In Fox Sports’ article, they state that bookmakers were so convinced that no team other than Manchester City or Chelsea would take home the title, they didn’t even bother to make odds for a Leicester victory.</p>
<p>The article also points out how many players Leicester let go over the summer, and how much money they spent on replacements. They even state “it looked like a recipe for disaster”.</p>
<p>But disaster didn’t strike. In fact, Leicester thrived. Jamie Vardy set a new record by scoring in 11 consecutive games, and Riyad Mahrez was named Player of the Season.</p>
<p>And now, they are Premier League Champions. Claudio Ranieri has led an amazing underdog story that no one could have predicted.</p>
<h1 id="Leicester-City-pulls-off-biggest-upset-in-sports-history"><a href="#Leicester-City-pulls-off-biggest-upset-in-sports-history" class="headerlink" title="Leicester City pulls off biggest upset in sports history"></a>Leicester City pulls off biggest upset in sports history</h1><p>The impossible happened. Leicester City, a team with 5,000-to-1 odds of winning the Premier League at the start of the season, are champions.</p>
<p>This is the biggest upset in sports history. Few could have imagined it possible. But it happened. Against all odds, Leicester City pulled off one of the most miraculous championships in history.</p>
<p>What makes their story even more remarkable is that they did it without spending huge sums of money on players. Instead, they relied on teamwork and unity – something that was sorely lacking at some of the other top clubs in the league.</p>
<p>Leicester’s journey to the top has been an incredible one. They narrowly avoided relegation last season, and only just made it into this year’s Premier League. But they started to click midway through this season, and soon found themselves contending for the title.</p>
<p>Their players deserve a lot of credit for this improbable championship victory. Jamie Vardy, Riyad Mahrez, N’Golo Kanté and Wes Morgan all played brilliantly throughout the season, scoring key goals and making crucial tackles when needed most.</p>
<p>Claudio Ranieri, Leicester City’s manager, must also be given credit for masterminding this upset victory. He helped to build a strong team spirit at Leicester, and got the best out of his players when it mattered most.</p>
<p>Leicester City’s triumph is a true sports Cinderella story – an underdog who defied all odds to win the big prize. It will go down in history as one of the greatest sporting miracles ever witnessed.</p>
<h1 id="It’s-a-fairy-tale-ending-for-Leicester-City-as-they-win-Premier-League"><a href="#It’s-a-fairy-tale-ending-for-Leicester-City-as-they-win-Premier-League" class="headerlink" title="It’s a fairy tale ending for Leicester City as they win Premier League"></a>It’s a fairy tale ending for Leicester City as they win Premier League</h1><p>It’s a fairy tale ending for Leicester City as they win Premier League. For the first time in their 132-year history, Leicester City are the champions of England, having come from behind to beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 on Sunday.</p>
<p>Spurs looked to have done enough when Harry Kane scored late on to make it 1-1, but two goals in the space of two minutes from Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez won it for Leicester.</p>
<p>Claudio Ranieri’s side had been written off by many at the start of the season, but they have proved all the doubters wrong to seal one of the most remarkable underdog stories in sporting history.</p>
<p>Leicester were 5,000/1 outsiders at the start of the season and many people thought they would be relegated. But they have been simply superb throughout, playing some attractive and exciting football along the way.</p>
<p>Jamie Vardy has been central to their success, scoring 24 goals in 36 Premier League appearances, while Riyad Mahrez has also been outstanding with 17 goals and 11 assists.</p>
<p>The likes of Kasper Schmeichel, Danny Simpson, Wes Morgan, N’Golo Kante and Christian Fuchs have also played a key role in Leicester’s success and they will now be rewarded with Champions League football next season.</p>
