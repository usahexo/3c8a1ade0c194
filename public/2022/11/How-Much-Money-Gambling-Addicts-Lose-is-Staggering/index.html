        <h1 id="How-Much-Money-Gambling-Addicts-Lose-is-Staggering"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Gambling-Addicts-Lose-is-Staggering" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Gambling Addicts Lose is Staggering"></a>How Much Money Gambling Addicts Lose is Staggering</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a real and serious problem. The amount of money that gambling addicts lose is staggering.</p>
<p>Most people think that gambling is a harmless pastime, but the reality is that gambling can be very addictive and destructive. Gambling addicts lose billions of dollars each year. This money could be used to support families, pay bills, or save for retirement.</p>
<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling reports that 2-3% of the adult population in the United States are pathological gamblers. This means that they are unable to resist the urge to gamble, even when it causes them harm.</p>
<p>Pathological gamblers account for nearly half of all gambling losses in the United States. They lose an average of $55,000 per year. This comes out to $220 per day!</p>
<p>Many people who are addicted to gambling started with small bets, but their addiction quickly grew out of control. Gambling can be very expensive and can quickly lead to financial ruin.</p>
<p>Gambling addicts often end up maxing out their credit cards, borrowing money from family and friends, or selling possessions in order to get more money to gamble with. They often experience intense mood swings as they try to chase their losses.</p>
<p> bankruptcy filings have increased in recent years as more people have become addicted to gambling. In 2017, there were over 1 million bankruptcy filings in the United States that were related to gambling debts.</p>
<p>Addicts often feel ashamed and humiliated about their addiction and try to keep it secret from family and friends. This can make it difficult for them to seek help or get the support they need.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for addicts and their families. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help immediately. There is no shame in asking for help, and treatment options are available if you are ready to get sober</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Addiction-Costs-Addicts-Millions"><a href="#Gambling-Addiction-Costs-Addicts-Millions" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Addiction Costs Addicts Millions"></a>Gambling Addiction Costs Addicts Millions</h1><p>Gambling addiction can be a costly habit, both financially and emotionally. According to statistics compiled by the National Council on Problem Gambling, problem gamblers in the United States lose an estimated $5 billion annually. This number includes both money spent on gambling activities and money lost as a result of gambling-related problems.</p>
<p>The emotional toll of gambling addiction is also high. compulsive gamblers often experience anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders. They may also have problems with relationships, finances, and employment.</p>
<p>There are many ways to treat gambling addiction. Some people seek help from therapists or counselors; others attend self-help groups or participate in online programs. There are also medications that can help address some of the symptoms of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know has a problem with gambling, it is important to seek help as soon as possible. The cost of gambling addiction can be high, but there are treatments available that can help you overcome this disorder.</p>
<h1 id="Study-Gambling-Addicts-Lose-104-000-on-Average"><a href="#Study-Gambling-Addicts-Lose-104-000-on-Average" class="headerlink" title="Study: Gambling Addicts Lose $104,000 on Average"></a>Study: Gambling Addicts Lose $104,000 on Average</h1><p>According to a recent study, gambling addicts lose an average of $104,000 per year. This is more than twice the amount of money that non-gambling addicts lose.</p>
<p>The study, which was conducted by the University of British Columbia, surveyed nearly 2,000 people who had problems with gambling. It found that gambling addicts lost an average of $91,000 more than non-gambling addicts.</p>
<p>They also found that the majority of gambling addicts (59%) had experienced major financial problems as a result of their addiction, such as bankruptcy, job loss, and home foreclosure.</p>
<p>Experts say that the findings highlight the need for better treatment options for gambling addiction. Currently, there are very few treatments available that are specifically tailored for this type of addiction.</p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that gambling addiction is a major problem in terms of economic health,” said lead author Dr. Anna Sergunina. “This is especially true for those addicted to internet gambling or slot machines.”</p>
<p>Dr. Sergunina added that more research is needed to determine why some people become addicted to gambling while others do not. She also called for better prevention and treatment programs for gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-costs-Canadians-millions-of-dollars-each-year"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-costs-Canadians-millions-of-dollars-each-year" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction costs Canadians millions of dollars each year"></a>Gambling addiction costs Canadians millions of dollars each year</h1><p>Gambling addiction, also known as problem gambling, is one of the most serious addictions in Canada. According to a study by the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, problem gambling costs Canadians more than $4 billion each year in social and economic costs.</p>
<p> Problem gamblers are at increased risk for a number of negative consequences, including mental health problems, financial ruin, and criminal activity. In fact, a recent report by the Canadian Gaming Association found that almost half of all crime in Canada is linked to gambling activities.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have a devastating impact on the lives of both the individual and their loved ones. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to seek help right away. There are many resources available for people affected by problem gambling, including counselling and support groups.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addicts-lose-staggering-amount-of-money"><a href="#Gambling-addicts-lose-staggering-amount-of-money" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addicts lose staggering amount of money"></a>Gambling addicts lose staggering amount of money</h1><p>A study recently published in the journal Addiction found that gambling addicts lose an average of $US13,777 per year, almost twice as much as problem gamblers who don’t have a substance use disorder.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Calgary and the University of British Columbia, looked at data from nearly 5,000 people who had participated in the Canadian National gambling survey.</p>
<p>It found that 38 percent of gambling addicts lost money on their most recent gambling session, compared to 22 percent of problem gamblers without a substance use disorder.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for individuals and families. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, about two million Americans are addicted to gambling, and another four to six million are considered at-risk for developing a problem.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can lead to financial ruin, job loss, relationship problems, and even suicide. The good news is that gambling addiction is treatable; with help, individuals can learn to manage their condition and rebuild their lives.</p>
