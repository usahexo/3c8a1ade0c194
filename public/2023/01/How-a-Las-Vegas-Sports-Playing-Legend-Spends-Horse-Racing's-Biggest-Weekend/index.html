<p>A horse racing enthusiast and occasional player himself, Earnhardt is looking forward to the weekend’s races for the competition, camaraderie and chance to place some bets.</p>
<p>“It’ll be a lot of fun,” said Earnhardt. “I’m just looking forward to being around some great people and enjoying some good racing.”</p>
<p>For people like Earnhardt, the Breeders’ Cup is as much about sports wagering as it is about watching horses run. And with nearly $300 million in bets expected to be placed on the Breeders’ Cup races alone this year, there’s plenty of money at stake.</p>
<p>While most bettors will focus on picking the winners, there are also opportunities to make money by betting against the field (known as “ taking the Field”) or betting on matchups between individual horses. So even if you’re not an expert handicapper, there are still ways to make money off of the races.</p>
<p>And with so many races taking place over such a short period of time, there’s always something worth betting on at the Breeders’ Cup. Whether you’re a novice or a seasoned pro, here are four tips that can help you make money off of this year’s Championship Races:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Do your research: before placing any bets, it’s important to do your homework and familiarize yourself with the horses and jockeys competing in each race. This includes checking out past performances and studying each horse’s odds. While it’s always tempting to bet on a longshot, doing your research can help you spot potential upset victories by underdogs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep track of early odds movements: often times, early odds movements can be an indicator of which horses are attracting heavy betting action from experts and insiders. So if you see a horse’s odds move significantly in either direction, it might be worth placing a bet on that horse before all the smart money comes in.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use multiple betting strategies: instead of relying on one strategy (e.g., picking winners), try using multiple strategies simultaneously to increase your chances of winning money. This could include betting on favorites, underdogs and/or matchups between specific horses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have fun! Above all else, remember that gambling should be enjoyed for its entertainment value rather than viewed as an opportunity to make money fast. So don’t get too caught up in trying to win big – just relax and enjoy watching some of the best thoroughbreds in the world compete for glory.</p>
</li>

Held every year at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, it’s a massive event that attracts drivers and fans from all over the globe.</p>
<p>But what happens during race weekend? What are the drivers doing when they’re not on the track? How do they prepare for one of the most important races of their career?</p>
<p>We spoke to some of the best drivers in the business to get their thoughts on Indy 500 prep. Here’s what they had to say:</p>
<p>317 mile an hour average speed!!! I always enjoy coming to Indianapolis Motor Speedway! It’s a privilege to drive these cars at that speed and be able to race wheel-to-wheel with my peers. The week leading up to the race is always full of anticipation and excitement as we all try and get our cars dialed in for qualifying! - Will Power</p>
<p>Race weekend is always a busy time, but it’s also a lot of fun! I love spending time with my family and friends, and I also enjoy checking out all of the different vendors and attractions at the track. Of course, I also spend a lot of time practicing and trying to get comfortable in the car. The Indy 500 is a very unique race, and it takes a lot of practice to be able to compete at that level. - Ed Carpenter</p>
<p>I love spending time with my family and friends during Indy 500 weekend. My kids always enjoy coming to the track, and they love watching me race. We also like exploring all of the different things that Indy has to offer - there’s always something new to see or do! And of course, I spend plenty of time practicing in order to be as prepared as possible for this big race. The Indy 500 is definitely one of my favorite events of the year! - Tony Kanaan</p>
<h1 id="Spending-Horse-Racing’s-Biggest-Weekend-Like-a-Pro"><a href="#Spending-Horse-Racing’s-Biggest-Weekend-Like-a-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Spending Horse Racing’s Biggest Weekend Like a Pro"></a>Spending Horse Racing’s Biggest Weekend Like a Pro</h1><p>There’s nowhere quite like the racetrack on a big race weekend. The crowds, the energy, the horses - it’s all intoxicating.</p>
<p>If you’re heading to the track this weekend, whether it’s for Cheltenham or the Grand National, here are some tips to make sure you make the most of it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plan your day. It can be easy to get swept up in the excitement of a big race meeting, but if you want to see as many races as possible (and who doesn’t?), it’s important to plan your day in advance. Work out which races you want to see and then figure out where they’re taking place on the course. This way you can make sure you’re in the right spot well in advance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bring a picnic. There’s nothing quite like enjoying a good old fashioned picnic on a sunny day at the races. Make sure you bring some delicious food and drink to enjoy while you watch the action unfold in front of you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dress for success. If there’s one time where it’s ok to dress up a little bit, it’s at the racetrack. So pull out your smartest outfits and enjoy feeling like a VIP for a day.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t forget your betting slip! One of the best things about attending horse racing meetings is putting your bets on the horses. Make sure you come prepared with plenty of betting slips so that you can make some money while you’re there!</p>
</li>
</ul>

But how the top trainers and jockeys spend their time at the track varies greatly.</p>
<p>While many of the pros spend the week before Breeders’ Cup finalizing their plans and last-minute workouts, a few take a very different approach.</p>
<p>For example, trainer Bob Baffert often takes his horses to Santa Anita Park for some light training in the days leading up to Breeders’ Cup. This year, he brought two of his horses – Mubtaahij and Hoppertunity – to Hollywood Park for some races leading up to the big event.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other trainers like D. Wayne Lukas focus on keeping their horses’ minds occupied in the days leading up to Breeders’ Cup. Lukas often brings his horses to a new track in the days leading up to the event, and this year he took them to Churchill Downs.</p>
<p>“I always try to change something and keep them guessing,” said Lukas. “The more things they see, the better.”</p>
<p>And then there are the jockeys, who often have completely different strategies for preparing for Breeders’ Cup. While some like Gary Stevens stick to light workouts in the days leading up to the race, others like John Velazquez prefer to ride as many horses as possible.</p>
<p>“I just want to stay busy,” said Velazquez. “If I’m not riding good horses, then I’m not going anywhere.”</p>

Held two weeks apart, they are both major tests for 3-year-olds looking to qualify for the Triple Crown. As a professional horse racing handicapper, I have to stay on my toes to make sure I’m making the right bets these two weekends.</p>
<h1 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>In this article, I’ll share my tips on how to bet on the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. I’ll also give you my thoughts on which horses are likely to win these races. Let’s get started!</p>

Here are four horses that I think have a good chance of winning:</h1><ol>
<li>Justify : Justify is currently the favorite to win this race, and for good reason – he has won all four of his races so far! He is fast and has great stamina, which makes him a strong contender in longer races like the Kentucky Derby. His odds are currently 5/4 .  2) Audible : Audible is also undefeated this year, and he finished second behind Justify in last month’s Florida Derby. He is considered a bit of an underdog but could definitely surprise everyone and take home first prize. His odds are currently 8/1 .  3) Good Magic : Good Magic was last year’s champion juvenile colt, so he has already proven himself against some tough competition. He didn’t quite live up to expectations in his last race (the Blue Grass Stakes), but he could still pull off an upset victory at Churchill Downs. His odds are currently 12/1 . 4) Bolt d’Oro : Bolt d’Oro is another strong contender – he won last year’s Breeders’ Cup Juvenile and was recently named California Horse of the Year. He faltered somewhat in his last race (the Santa Anita Derby), but he could still redeem himself with a win at the Kentucky Derby. His odds are currently 8/1 .</li>
